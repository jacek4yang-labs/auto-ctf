# CTF2 Platform Agent Skill

Use this skill when the user wants an AI assistant to operate CTF2 through the platform's authorized MCP tools. It covers profile inspection, daily challenge discovery, practice ground browsing and attachments, challenge environment startup and access URLs, confirmed flag submission, competition status, submission review, support tickets, and learning recommendations.

## Required setup

Install the public `ctf2` CLI from the release manifest, verify its SHA-256 value, then use the command for the user's Agent:

`ctf2 agent setup codex`

`ctf2 agent setup claude`

`ctf2 agent setup gemini`

The CLI installs this complete Skill directory and calls the Agent's native user-scoped MCP command. Codex and Claude Code open their native browser OAuth flow. Gemini CLI requires the user to run `/mcp auth ctf2` in an interactive session. The CLI never stores OAuth tokens or PATs.

Run `ctf2 agent doctor <client>` after setup. The final end-to-end check is to ask the Agent to read the current CTF2 profile.

For manual installation, install the entire official ZIP package. Do not install only `SKILL.md`; the references and assets are required. Codex and Gemini use `~/.agents/skills/ctf2-platform`; Claude Code uses `~/.claude/skills/ctf2-platform`.

Request only the minimum scopes required for the task. Prefer read-only scopes until the user explicitly requests a write action. If browser OAuth is unavailable, use PATs only through environment variables for scripts; never persist a PAT in this Skill or an MCP configuration file.

Default endpoints:

- CLI release manifest: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/api/ai/v1/cli/releases/latest/manifest.json
- Official Skill package: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/api/ai/v1/skills/ctf2-platform/package.zip
- Standard MCP URL: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/api/ai/v1/mcp
- OAuth metadata: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
- Protected resource metadata: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/ai/v1/mcp
- User OpenAPI: https://ctf2.dasctf.com/api/openapi/v1/user.json

## Operating rules

- Use current-user permissions only. Do not attempt to bypass CTF2 authorization, scopes, rate limits, or audit logging.
- For read tasks, call the narrowest relevant tool or endpoint and summarize the result with IDs, names, status, and next actions.
- For environment startup, explain the target challenge first and ask for explicit confirmation when the user did not clearly request startup.
- When an environment is still starting, repeat the idempotent start call until `access_ready` is true, then return `access_url` or `access_urls` to the user.
- For flag submission, always require explicit user confirmation and pass `confirmation: true` only after the user confirms the exact flag and challenge.
- For admin or integration automation, direct the user to the CTF2 admin OpenAPI and require an explicitly authorized admin identity. Do not reuse a user grant for admin workflows.
- If a tool fails with missing scope, tell the user the exact missing scope and reconnect or re-authorize only when the user agrees.
- Treat 401 as an expired or revoked connection, 403 as missing scope or permission, and 429 as a signal to wait for `Retry-After`.

## Standard workflow

1. Identify the user's intent: read profile, inspect learning tasks, operate a practice challenge, inspect competitions, review submissions, or administer integrations.
2. Check required scopes in `references/mcp-tools.md` or `references/open-api.md`.
3. Prefer MCP tools for assistant-driven workflows; use Open API endpoints for scripts and external systems.
4. Execute the smallest safe action.
5. Return concise results and include follow-up choices instead of performing additional write operations automatically.

## Tool discovery and CLI fallback

Read `references/mcp-tools.md` for the complete generated MCP tool catalog, exact arguments, and scopes. Do not maintain a separate tool list in this file. Read `references/safety.md` before write operations.

MCP with native OAuth is the default Agent path. If the Agent has no MCP client, use `ctf2 operations` and `ctf2 describe <operation-id>` for discovery, then `ctf2 call <operation-id>` with a PAT supplied only through `CTF2_TOKEN`.
